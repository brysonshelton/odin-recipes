    <h3>Bryson's Popcorn Chicken</h3>

    <p>Popcorn chicken is a dish of bite-sized chunks of deep-fried chicken that are sure to be a family favorite. I love to serve the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <p><li>Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.</li></p>
      <p><li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li></p>
      <p><li>Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat.</li></p>
      <p><li>Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li></p>
    </ol>
